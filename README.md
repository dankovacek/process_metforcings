# Process Meteorological Forcings from Daymet

This repository contains code for processing daily meteorological (or any timeseries spatial data) using catchment polygons. 

The code can clip and save daily timeseries in its spatially distributed for, but this is extremely data intensive so the code averages daily values over the catchment.
